# DTPrefabSandbox
Edit Prefabs quickly - in a sandbox!

### To install:
Clone the git repository and add the entire folder to your Unity project.

At the moment, DTPrefabSandbox cannot be used without [DTCommandPalette](https://github.com/DarrenTsung/DTCommandPalette).

### Supported Versions:
Tested on Unity 5.4. It will probably work on other similar versions..

### Features:
Instead of dragging prefabs out into the scene to edit them, open them in a prefab sandbox!

DTPrefabSandbox will instantiate the prefab into a sandbox scene. You can customize the sandbox scene by creating a prefab named PrefabSandboxSetupPrefab in the project.

### How To Use:
1. Open [DTCommandPalette](https://github.com/DarrenTsung/DTCommandPalette) with `%t (Cmd-T on Mac / Ctrl-T on Windows)`
* Search for your Prefab and press enter
* Edit the prefab
* Press "Save and Exit"
* Done!
